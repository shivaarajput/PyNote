# 📘 Practical Copy

## Python Programming Lab (MCA-301)

A **React-based web application** that presents Python lab experiments in the form of a **digital practical copy**.

The application is designed to closely resemble a **traditional academic Python practical record**, while adding modern interactivity such as **code editing and live execution**.

## 👀 What the App Looks Like

* 📄 **A4 Practical Copy Layout**
  Each experiment appears like a real lab record page with proper margins, headings, and spacing.

* 🧾 **Experiment Format**
  Every experiment includes:

  * Experiment number and date
  * Title
  * Aim
  * Procedure
  * Python program
  * Expected output

* 💻 **Built-in Code Editor**
  Python programs are displayed in an editor with syntax highlighting and can be modified by the user.

* ▶️ **Run Python Code**
  Code can be executed directly in the browser using an online compiler.

* 📤 **Output Handling**
  Expected output is shown by default and is replaced by actual output after execution.

* 🧭 **Simple Navigation**
  Includes an index page and next/previous buttons for moving between experiments.

* 📱 **Responsive Design**
  Desktop view follows a fixed A4-style layout, while mobile view adapts to a clean, readable format.

## 📦 Data Source

All experiments are loaded from a single JSON file:

```
experiments.json
```

This allows easy updates to experiment content without changing the application logic.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is intended for:

* MCA Python Programming Lab (MCA-301)
* Digital practical record submission
* Academic demonstration and learning
